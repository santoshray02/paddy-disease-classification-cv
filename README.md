# Classification of Paddy Diseases Using Computer Vision Techniques

This project focuses on the automated classification of paddy diseases using computer vision and machine learning techniques. We utilize the "Paddy Doctor" dataset for training and evaluation of our models.

## Dataset

We use the "Paddy Doctor" visual image dataset, which can be found at:
